# IT Logger with React and JSON DB

## Introduction
This is the third part of the React Front to Back course from Brad Traversy

The Project aims to understand the components structure and the accompanying UI for this simple one page application, and the Redux for the State management to fascilitate data sharing across various components. Creates a tangible data structure to call multiple times

## Future enhancement
Since this is a base application, I might use this to further strengthen my core understanding in ReactJS. 

Personal opinion: I might be too used to PHP and DotNet, but by understanding new techs, I not only expand my knowledge of programming, but the hows and why. Yes, I am rambling here
